# Greedy Mesher

My take on the algorithm described here https://github.com/mikolalysenko/mikolalysenko.github.com/blob/gh-pages/MinecraftMeshes/js/greedy.js by Mikola Lysenko.

Added more information to the generated quads/triangles to use for further processing and generally tried to be as explicit in regards to what is happening as possible.

## Example

To see a simple example, serve the project root using (for example) `python -m 'http.server'`and navigate to "localhost:8000/example/' in your browser. Each page refresh will create a random mesh.
